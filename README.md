This Repo contains general Latex Templates for Applications. The Templates are free to use. Please contact me if you need help compiling.

In order to run the workspcae the easiest way is to build it on gitpod.io. The Latex environment will automatically be created and after changing and saving the main.tex file, the output PDF will change automatically.
