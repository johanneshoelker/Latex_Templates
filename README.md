This Repo contains general Latex Templates for Applications. The Templates are free to use. Please contact me if you need help compiling.

In order to run the workspcae the easiest way is to build it on gitpod.io. The Latex environment will automatically be created and after changing and saving the main.tex file, the output PDF will change automatically.

The workspace is meant for running on gitpod.io or any other Latex setup. Gitpod is a Cloud Development Environment (CDE) which enables working on Code using Visual Studio Code in a Browser (same as Github Codespaces but with more RAM). In order to run the setup follow these steps:
- Create your own github account
- Log in to Github
- Click on "+" in the top right corner and "Import Repositories"
- Insert this link for existing repo: https://github.com/johanneshoelker/Latex_Templates
- Add a name for your own repo
- Log in to gitpod.io using the github Account
- Add a new Workspace with the recently created repo
- The startup of the repo probably takes a while. 
- Now you are ready to work using the templates.
